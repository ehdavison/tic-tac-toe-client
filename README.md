# Tic-Tac-Toe Technologies
    This tic-tac-toe game uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a backend api to function.
During development I used resources from my classmates issue queue, stack overflow,
w3schools, MDN web docs and other advice from friends.

## Tic-Tac-Toe Planning
        Planning for this application started written down with pen and paper. After brainstorming 
    organizational ideas and approaches I wrote out my wireframes and uploaded them to imgur[https://imgur.com/gallery/tTyUftc].
    After drawing up a representation of what I felt was a functional website I went into game locgic brainstorming. imgur[https://imgur.com/a/Bc55LJU]
    After some 1:1 interviews about my planning process there were revisional materials I wrote out that ended up being what I implemented. 
    Development of the game logic was a huge struggle for me at first. Most of the challenges I encountered was not commenting and using console.log
    before moving on to another step or feature. This hindsight error caused me to spend a lot of time backtracking into passed features that were breaking 
    due to either race issues or just plain sloppy code writing. It took me about two full days of work to undo some of the errors from earlier in the week.
    I was, and still am determined to make this application fully functional before any styling appears on the page due to my own personal ability to procrastinate. After a good clean-up of my code and some major reorganization I solved my race problem by simply finding out where my event handlers were firing off and changing how I turned them on and off. I felt on top of the world whenever I overcame that huge hurdle and I learned so much from it.

### Unsolved Problems and Future Plans
    I would like to implement more styling and user friendly interfacing in the future. Some things I would like to do is make my code more efficient and DRY. There are a lot of places where my code is super wet. This causes the game to break if you click too quickly and is annoying(esspecially during testing). My goal is to make this webpage unique and something I can be proud of to have on my portfolio.


#### User Stories
    Perspectives:
        Casual user: A casual user could use this webpage and easily sign-up and keep track of playing their tic-tac-toe games. The appeal to a casual user would mostly be in the functionality and ease of use.

        Competitive user: A competitive user would be able to keep track of their games played(and idealy who won). The ability for them to make an account and keep track of their games would be a huge benefit for them.

        A Colleague: A colleague would see implementation of features in an organized way with clear comments and file structure. Hopefully they will see a project that is a representation of hard-work and research.
